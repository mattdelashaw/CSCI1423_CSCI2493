These will be whatever I can dig up from my first programming classes


After searching through hard drives and not finding much, i remembered all my files were on a VPS that I no longer have access to and I was dumb to not have backup/copies

There are a few number generator applications in this repo. NO! im not addicted to lottery gambling. I just found it to present a fun challenge. I recently added CustomLotto.java which creates a custom spring layout GUI and error handling. Go hit those big million dollar prizes people! Don't forget about me if you do!

To run the latest project displayed above, download the repo, and extract the CustomLotto* class files, and the spring utility class file, all into the same directory. Open a command prompt or terminal in that directory and enter `java CustomLotto`
